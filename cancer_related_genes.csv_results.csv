In this melanoma study, while CTLA4 is not directly examined, immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 show differential expression in groups classified by a ferroptosis-related gene signature. This suggests a potential link between CTLA4, immune checkpoints, and ferroptosis pathways in melanoma progression and therapy.","Ping, S., Wang, S., Zhao, Y., He, J., Li, G., Li, D., Wei, Z., & Chen, J.
