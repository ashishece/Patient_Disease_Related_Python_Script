Mutations in this gene can lead to conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by affecting brain circuits involved in language learning and social interaction.","PeÂ¤agarikano, O., & Geschwind, D.

Variation in this gene is linked to traits similar to autism, such as trouble with language and social skills. This gene variation might also affect intelligence.","Shiota, Y., Hirosawa, T., Yoshimura, Y., Tanaka, S., Hasegawa, C., Iwasaki, S., An, K., Soma, D., Sano, M., Yokoyama, S., & Kikuchi, M. (2021).

CNTNAP2 is found in cells alongside markers for these pathways, suggesting it plays a role in keeping brain cells healthy.","Zhang, Q., Sterling, K., & Song, W. (2023).

It's more prone to certain genetic changes that can affect how it works. In people with Alzheimer's, this gene and others like it tend to be less active in parts of the brain that control memory. This reduced activity may contribute to problems with thinking and remembering in Alzheimer's patients.","Soheili?Nezhad, S., Van Der Linden, R. J., Rikkert, M. G. M. O., Sprooten, E., & Poelmans, G.
